    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>What's so great about combining the worlds of coding and cuisine? 
        Dev Dish was founded by two passionate developers who turned their 
        love for software into a culinary adventure. After years of coding by 
        day and cooking by night, they decided to merge their two passions and 
        create something extraordinary.</p>
    <p>Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, offering a menu 
        full of creative, tech-inspired dishes. Whether you're a tech enthusiast 
        or a food lover, our offerings are designed to satisfy both your appetite 
        and your curiosity.</p>
    <p>Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends who met at a 
        hackathon and discovered a shared love for innovative cuisine. With a 
        background in software development and a knack for culinary creativity, 
        they embarked on a journey to deliver delicious, tech-themed dishes to the 
        community.</p>
